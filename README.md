If you are looking for a mockito-like fluent interface for mock check out [fluentmock](https://github.com/aelgru/fluentmock)

mockito-without-hardcoded-distribute-version
============================================


The mockito people thought it was a good idea to use a distribute bootstrapping script that downloads
distribute-0.6.10.tar.gz from PyPI and then tries to use that for the setup.

_They were wrong._


Mockito is unusable on python3 because of this and pip installs will fail with 
```
error: invalid command 'bdist_egg'
```

There is [a pull request pending at bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/szczepiq/mockito-python/pull-request/2/dont-download-distribute/diff
) (yes the sources are on bitbucket, not on code.google.com like the metadata on PyPI pretends) but there's been no activity up until now.



You can use this project (which is on PyPI) until the pull request is merged.
Just replace

```
pip install mockito
```

with

```
pip install mockito-without-hardcoded-distribute-version
```

You don't need to change anything else. This will work on python 2 and 3.
